Storage of the Mind
</P>
<p>
I need to remember this: Inline elements cannot contain any block level elements.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>action is the attribute that stores the url</li>
  <li>the method attribute specifies the http method used, basically use post for everything b/c better security</li>
  <li>
    I need to remember to use br often so webpages aren't cluttered
  </li>
</ul>

  why would the html creators use radio for empty bubbles?
</p>
<input type="radio" name="answer" value="its random" /> its random <br />
<input type="radio" name="answer" value="radio ends with a o" /> radio ends with a o <br />
<form>
    <input type="text" name="username" /><br />
    <input type="password" name="password" />
</form>
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
<li>
  the above should not work or do anyting
</li>
<p>
  Perfect example of why we need to learn how to process data "The submit button submits a form to its action attribute," confusing right?
  <br />
  well its really simple after you read this part "After the form is submitted, the data should be processed on the server using a programming language, such as PHP."
